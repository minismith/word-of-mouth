# What's Word of Mouth?

Word of Mouth is a Rails app built by a small team at Le Wagon coding school in London. It is a social network designed to take the guesswork out of eating out - instead of trawling through strangers' reviews on search engines, you can connect with friends to see their top spots in the city and leave your own reviews.
